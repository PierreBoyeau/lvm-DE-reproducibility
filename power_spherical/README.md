# The Power Spherical distribution

## Overview
This library contains a Pytorch implementation of the Power Spherical distribution, as presented in [[1]](#citation)(https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04437).

## Dependencies

* **python>=3.6**
* **pytorch>=1.5**: https://pytorch.org

*Notice that older version could work but they were not tested.*

Optional dependency for [examples](https://github.com/nicola-decao/power_spherical/blob/master/example.ipynb) needed for plotting and numerical checks (again older version could work but they were not tested):
* **numpy>=1.18.1**: https://numpy.org
* **matplotlib>=3.1.1**: https://matplotlib.org
* **quadpy>=0.14.11**: https://pypi.org/project/quadpy

## Installation

To install, run

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

## Structure
* [distributions](https://github.com/nicola-decao/power_spherical/blob/master/power_spherical/distributions.py): Pytorch implementation of the Power Spherical and hyperspherical Uniform distributions. Both inherit from `torch.distributions.Distribution`.
* [examples](https://github.com/nicola-decao/power_spherical/blob/master/example.ipynb): Example code for using the library within a PyTorch project.

## Usage
Please have a look into the [examples](https://github.com/nicola-decao/power_spherical/blob/master/example.ipynb). We adapted our implementation to follow the structure of the [Pytorch probability distributions](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html).

Here a minimal example that demonstrate differentiable sampling:
```python
>>> from power_spherical import PowerSpherical
>>> p = PowerSpherical(
      loc=torch.tensor([0., 1.], requires_grad=True),
      scale=torch.tensor(4., requires_grad=True),
    )
>>> p.rsample()

tensor([-0.1786,  0.9839], grad_fn=<SubBackward0>)
```
and computing KL divergence with the uniform distribution:
```python
>>> from power_spherical import HypersphericalUniform
>>> q = HypersphericalUniform(dim=2)
>>> torch.distributions.kl_divergence(p, q)

tensor(1.2486, grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)
```

Examples of 2D and 3D plots are show in [examples](https://github.com/nicola-decao/power_spherical/blob/master/example.ipynb) and will generate something similar to these figures below.
